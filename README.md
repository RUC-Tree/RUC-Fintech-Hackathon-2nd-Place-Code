## The First RUC Fintech Hackathon (2024) 2nd Place Code
### 1. Brief Introduction:
The School of Economics at Renmin University of China held a fintech hackathon (also called "quantitative modeling competition") from March to July in 2024. In this competition, contestants need to predict the prices of houses in the test set based on the data of houses and prices in the training set. The final score is determined by weighting the `MAE`, `MSE` and `Median Absolute Error` of the predictions. In this competition, I ranked second among 192 teams and also won the Best Modeling Award.
### 2. The Methods I used:
- Linear Models: `OLS`, `Lasso`, `Ridge`, `Elastic Net`
- Tree-based Models: `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`
- Neural Networks
### 3. The Packages I used:
`scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `openfe`, `autogluon`, `keras`
### 4. Innovations:
- A possible method to solve the data imbalance problem in Machine Learning: **Data Enhancement** (not yet proven by theory)
- A possible improvement based on the **White Test**ï¼šFit the residuals using more function forms, such as logarithms.
- An improvement of the initial neural network: **Wide ANN** (theoretically proven by Cheng, 2016)
- Application of `openfe` (for mining deep features) and `autogluon` (for Automated machine learning).
